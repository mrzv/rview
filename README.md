# rview

A terminal media viewer for the [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/). It shows a directory as a thumbnail grid, fuzzy-searches filenames, and opens images fullscreen. Video playback is optional.

Works in [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), and [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

## Install

```bash
cargo install --path .
cargo install --path . --features video   # requires ffmpeg 7+
```

## Usage

```bash
rview                                      # current directory
rview ~/photos
rview image.png                            # single file opens fullscreen
rview drawing.svg                          # SVG files also work in the gallery
rview photo.jpg screenshot.png
rview -t ~/.config/themes/nord.toml        # theme file, or a catalog name
rview -j 4 ~/photos                        # decode threads (default: all cores)
```

Themes load from `~/.config/rview/config.toml` (`theme`, `theme_catalog`). `-t` overrides the session. `t` previews the catalog; that choice is not written back.

## Formats

**Images:** PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, ICO, AVIF, SVG.

SVGs render as static images with transparency, system fonts, and local image references resolved relative to the SVG file. Thumbnails rasterize at the target size; fullscreen fit does not upscale beyond the SVG's intrinsic dimensions. Zoom and pan use an intrinsic-resolution raster, as with other images.

SVG thumbnails are cached only in memory so changes to referenced files appear when reopening the gallery. SVG raster buffers use the same 512 MiB allocation limit as the standard image decoder; an oversized intrinsic raster cannot be used for zoom, but a bounded fit or thumbnail can still render.

**Video** (`--features video`): MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, WebM, M4V. Playback loops at up to 10 fps. Gallery thumbnails use the first frame.
